A Galatic Index
What's the purpose of a galactic index anyways?  I've been asked as to why I created this index.  This site serves as a notebook, and it seemed a good idea to index any book.  Oddly enough, this book is not meant to be written from beginning to end.  How is that, you ask?  Simply start by indexing the term, then write the article.

    When does it end?  Initially, this was just my personal notebook, but a website has the capacity to be a world's notebook or even a galaxy's.  An individual's notes may end by way of their passing.  Only extinction will end humanity's notes.  I invite you to take notes as I have.  Perhaps I will read your notes as well as mine.  Do remember to avoid extinction.
